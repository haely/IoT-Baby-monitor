# IoT-Baby-monitor
Conclusion:
This project implements an infant activity monitor enabling parents and caretakers to keep an eye on the baby remotely. Parents/Guardians are notified via a  text message every time a baby is detected crying. An audio sensor measures the sound level every half an hour and updates the controller. With an increase in IoT based devices, more such sensors and monitors can be used which will eventually decrease the need for daycare. This project is implemented using off the shelf electronics and can easily be modified according to changing needs.
Future Scope:
Along with sound detectors, more health monitoring sensors (e.g. heart rate sensor) can be used to provide a bigger picture of the babyâ€™s health.
