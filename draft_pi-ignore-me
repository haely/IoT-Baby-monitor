   #The Sparkfun sound detector that we will be using has 5 pins: VCC (5V), GND, GATE, ENVELOPE and AUDIO. We will be using the GATE digital output, which is 1 when sound is detected, and 0 otherwise, and the ENVELOPE analog output, which represents the amplitude of the sound. We will be connecting the GATE pin to header #29 (WiringPi GPIO 21, using yellow wire), and the ENVELOPE pin to ADC.AIN0 on header #40 (blue wire).
